# Spritesheet Splicer
 ### Small WinForms app that allows you to splice spritesheets into individual PNG files
 
 Uses [Better Folder Browser](https://github.com/Willy-Kimura/BetterFolderBrowser) by Willy Kimura and [Fody](https://github.com/Fody/Fody)
 
 Unfortunately, antivirus software will often block the app from working, which is understandable, as it sometimes creates hundreds of files depending on the size of your spritesheet. If the app doesn't work, try temporarily disabling your antivirus.
